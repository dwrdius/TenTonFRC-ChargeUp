Autonomous balancing is working
Shooting is untested

Shooter is calibrated for middle goals
Shooter is 30% consistent for high goals

Cube is not integrated

Absolute arm limit implemented for safety
Arm top slowdown not yet implemented

Current limiting is temporary and does not actually prevent harmful commands from drivers*

Gyro zeroing seems to be fixed???? ~ still inconsistent

New joystick curves in progress

Intake is still manual

Limelight alignment works on a horizontal translation
*angular relies on driver zero* (A button on aux aligns to calibrated gyro zero)
